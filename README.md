
# Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Frontend Development

---------
## Project Description
---
Apart from putting to use the skills and techniques learnt with Code Institute in HTML and CSS, this 
project is also a prototype of a static website for an already-established music school in Barbados. 
	
The purpose of the project idea is to showcase an improved website, upgraded from the existing one to 
show a cleaner, attractive and organized front-end structure, as well as a better back-end structure 
(a cleaner and legible code). The focus of the website remains unchanged, to provide information and 
further insight into services and the nature of the school.  
	
Since the school already has a website, it will be a good challenge to come up with a new way to present 
its content as well as incorporating new features in a way that is appealing and useful for both the users 
and the owners.

## UX 

### User Background
---
My approach to the UX design was to input what I believed to be the necessary primary information,
without overloading them. To achieve this, I tried to put myself in the user's position and think of the 
type of information I would like to see if I were to visit the website, as well as how easy 
and accessible it would be if I were using the website on the move.

I started with the mobile first desing as most people nowadays are on the move and mostly check information 
on their mobile phones and after working on the desktop desing. I worked under the idea that majority of 
people looking at a music school are parents that would like an easy-to-access and easy-to-view website that 
conveys the information clearly with a simple way to contact the school or book lessons.

I also considered that the most popular instruments in the country should showcase on the front page, 
to create more opportunities for people to sign-up. 


### External Userâ€™s goal
---
People like options and, since up-to-date there is only one other school offering music classes in the 
country's market, I would like the user to know that there are other music services available that can 
be accessible to them with a more user centered focus when they visit the website.

- User stories

     * First Time Visitor Goals
		I want the visitor to see a clear layout of the information the owner wants to convey.
		That the visitor can clearly see and identify how to move around the website.
		I want visitors to have a way to contact the school easily.
		That they can find information about the teachers and services easily.
					
	* Returning Visitor Goals
		That information they might need later (such as prices or exams details) would be easily 
        accessible at all times and easy to find.
		That they can see and read about the tutors working for the school at any given time.
					 
	* Frequent User Goals
		That users can see general information on different topics, not only music (blog).
		See if there are any new members of staff and be able to find their information.
		See if there are new offers or news about the school or services provided.

 ### Site Owner's goals
---
- As there is only one other music school in the area, the owner wants to compete in the market.
- Increase awareness of the school within the country.
- To have an internet presence.
- Promote subscriptions.
- Promote accessible music teaching services.


### Market Research
---
Looking at the scope of the island's music tuition opportunities, there are two options: individually 
personalized classes from independent tutors or tuition from only one other music school. This presents 
a demand in the market for the school's niche services. The classes offered by the other school are given
in large groups, which generates difficulty in targeting specific needs for the students. There is also 
competition in price as the group classes allow for a price reduction, whereas the smaller classes given by 
the owner's school lead to an increase in price.
			
The focus, therefore, will be on showing that the school offers services for smaller groups which allows for 
more personalized tutoring, dependent on the needs of the student at an affordable or competing price,
for all ages.
			
Upon looking at various websites on the internet, I found that most use a clear layout to showcase 
their services with some using the colour scheme of their logos as base to convey their information, 
while others use a mixture. 
        
The plan is to use a three colour palette that is in line with the brand with a layout that looks 
professional, clean and not clustered.


## Design
		
### Logo
---
I will not be creating a logo since the school has one already. I will be working on the basis of 
the logo provided.
		
The logo has the school name (Hope Music Academy) with the "Hope" as the center stage and the treble 
clef replacing the "o" in Hope. It uses green and black colours with some white lines. The background 
of the logo can be transparent but it seems to present better against a white back ground.
		
Since it is for a music school, the logo seems appropriate for the intention and I will not suggest any 
changes, but will recommend to show the logo with a white background as much as possible.

### Colour Palette
---
From the small marketing research I did, I realized that there was not a specific colour associated with 
music tuition, therefore I will use the colours in line with the logo (green and black specifically) for 
continuity and consistency. 

I will be using a total of four colour palettes on the website:

- #232323 (dark - Black/Dark brown)
- #399E5A (Green - lighter shade)
- #073B3A (Green - darker shade)
- #F0FFFF (azure - white)
		
### Typography / Fonts
---    
Fonts will be imported from the Google Font repository. The main text for all round is 
Raleway with Sand Serif as fall back font. With a default color of #073B3A (Green - darker shade)
against a white background. This color will be overwritten depending on the background colour needed, 
i.e for buttons, font color will be #F0FFFF (azure - white) for example.

### Images
---
All the images used were photographs under the Creative Commons licenses taken from websites 
such as Flickr, FreeImages.com, Pixabay and some images and video link from the actual 
Hope Music Academy - UK website with the agreement and knowledge of the owner.

### Skeleton
---
A .PDF file can be found [HERE](https://nickyfrs.github.io/hma-bds/Wireframes/HMA-BDS-Wireframe.pdf) with a wireframe meda with Figma shoing the mobile navigation 
idea for desktop and mobile, as well as the footer wireframe for mobile and the entire idea for 
the Homepage layout for the website

### Scope
---
I wanted visitors of the site to know immediately what it was about and what information they could 
find there. And I also wanted the structure to be very simple to enable users to make the minimum number 
of clicks to access the desired information. 

### User Journey
---
To build a quick sense of familiarity, the navbar will be on the top right side of the screen, 
moving to the middle of the screen on the mobile view. The navigation structure, content and 
location of the navbar will be the same for each webpage.

The navbar has 3 pages listed: Home , About and Contact, with the Home page containing the most information 
about the services provided. The footer features every way the school can be contacted and a small 
quick-contact form.

On the About page (link through the navigation menu), the user sees a list of four sections which are the 
company's value. By default each value/section is collapsed, but expands on mouse click to show its 
description. I further differentiate each section with colour that can be seen on mouse hover for 
each section.  

Finally, on the Contact page, the user will find a contact form as a body of the page and underneath a google 
map showing the location of the address where lessons are held. On this page I employ the help of Bootstrap 
for the collapsible option and for the progress bars shown in the Core Values section where I used 
them for the company's five core values. 

90% of the website used custom code to produce a dynamic responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop 
use of this site. This included the repositioning of text over images to ensure legibility.


## Features

### Current Features
---
This site currently contains the following features:
- Home page - Two call to action sections, a small intro to the company, a section of the lessons provided, a Home Tuition video promo and a quick booking trial form.  
- About page - Talk about hoe the company came to be and their values.
- Contact page - Allows the user to get in contact for business services.
- Showcases photos and information about the teachers as well as images for the instruments the school teaches.  
- Provides an option for people to contact the school.

### Future Features
---
- Pages for each one of the tutors with more details of their experiences.
- Create pages for more school services and price information
- A blog space for sharing stories and from those, create an acknowledgements or recommended section in the Home page 
- Create an account section for pupils to sign up and communicate with teachers, see grades, and book lessons.

## Testing
---
 A number of testing was carried out once the website was complete. A spreadsheet and PDFs files were created for all 
 the tests and can be found in the folder Test-Validation [https://github.com/NickyFrs/hma-bds/tree/main/Test-Validation](https://github.com/NickyFrs/hma-bds/tree/main/Test-Validation).
 
**Validations**

- The css stylesheet was input directly into the W3C CSS validator and approved for all three pages. 
- All pages - index.html, about.html and contact.html - were input directly into the W3C Markup validator. Errors and warnings for each page were addressed and then the page was rechecked through the validator. The process was repeated until no warning remained.
- A css stylesheet was created for each .html page.
- Color Contrast Validation carried out.
- Lighthouse Extended Report for performance produced.
- Request mas created.
- [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

**Manual Testing**

- Manual testing was carried out on all the links and buttons on every page - all links in the footers and the navbars.
- The read more and submit buttons were all checked as well. 
- The collapse feature on the About page works fine.
- The website was inspected using Google Chrome Dev Tools to view it on mobile and tablet versions. Each page was viewed and tested in these views.
- A small and quick peer review was carried out for look and responsiveness which came up with positive feedback.

**Site Responsiveness**

To ensure compatibility and responsiveness, I tested the site on multiple browsers and devices: 

- **Browsers:** Chrome, Opera, FireFox, Edge

- **Devices:** In addition to testing responsivness with Chrome, Firefox, Edge inspector emulator tool, I also asked four people to test on their mobile devices and computers.

**Contact Form**

There are two contact forms on the site. 
 
If a site visitor is interested in contacting the school or booking a trial, the form will: 

1. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields (name and email) appears
2. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
3. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.


## Deployment of Website
---
This website was developed and hosted using **GitPod and GitHub pages** and stored in repositories on Github. 

Gitpod was installed as an extension
tool on Google Chrome, which was accessed then via the project's repository page on Github. This allowed for 
regular version control updates:
0. git status was entered to check for any changes on file that needed commit.
1. git add . was entered into the command line interface to add files to the staging area.
2. git commit -m "" committed the files to the repository.
3. git push -u origin master pushed the master branch.
 
The website was deployed using Github Pages. To do this while in the github webpages of the project repository: 
1. on the menu that appears on the right hand side of the page under 'Environments' you can find a link to `github-pages` with anc Active batch on the side.
2. Click on either, github-pages or Environments, it will take you to the `Deployment history` page.
3. Once on the Deployment history page on the right had side you will se a `View Deployment` button. 
4. Click on `View Deployment` and this will open the home page of the websit in a new window.

Alternatively the links below can be use to directly open the website or go to the repositories:
