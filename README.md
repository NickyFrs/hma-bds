
# Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Frontend Development

---------
## Project Description
---
A part from putting to use the skills and techniques learned with Code Institute in HTML and CSS this 
project is also a prototype of a static website for an already established music school in Barbados. 
	
The project idea is to showcase a better build website than the one that they already have to show a 
more clean, attractive and organized front-end structure as well as a better back-end structure 
(a more clean and readable code). The focus of the website is the same as initially intended, 
Information about services provided and the school.  
	
Since the school already has a website, it will be a good challenge to come up with a new way to present 
its content as well as incorporating new features in a way that is appealing and useful for both the users 
and the owners.

## UX 

### User Background
---
My approach to the UX design was to put information that I believe the user might need but not overloadd 
with information just the nessesary primary information. To do this, I try to put me in the user's 
position and think of what kind of information I would like to see if I visit the website and how easy 
and accesible would be if I am on the move.

I Started with the mobile first desing as most people nowadays are on the move and mostly check information 
on their mobile phones and after working on the desktop desing. Worked under the idea that most people 
looking at a music school are parents that just want an easy to access and easy to look website that 
convey the information clearly with simple way to contact or book lessons.

I also considered the most popular instruments in the country should should showcase in the front page 
to create more signing uo opportunities. 


### External user’s goal
---
People like options, since up to date there is only one other school offering music classes in the 
country's market, I like the user to know that there are other music services out there that can be 
accessible to them with more user center focus when the visit the website.

- User stories

     * First Time Visitor Goals
		I want the visitor to see a clear layout of the information the owner wants to convey.
		That the visitor can clearly see and identify how to move around the website.
		I want visitors to have a way to contact the school easy.
		That they can find information about the teachers and services easy.
					
	* Returning Visitor Goals
		That information they might need later (like prices or exams details) would easily 
        accessible at all time and easy to find.
		That they can see and read about the tutors working for the school at any given time.
					 
	* Frequent User Goals
		That users can see general information on different topics not only music (blog).
		See if there is any new member of staff and their information.
		See if there a new offers or news about the school or services provided.

 ### Site Owner's goals
---
- As there is only one other music school in the area the owner wants to compete in the market.
- Increase awareness of the school within the country.
- To have a internet presence.
- Promote subscriptions.
- Promote accessible music teaching services.


### Market Research
---
Looking at the scope of the island's music teaching opportunities, apart from individual personalized 
classes from independent tutors, there is only one music school. This present a competition opportunity 
and challenges. the classes offered are in group which make it difficult to target specific needs for 
the student. There's also competition in price as the group classes make it cheaper. 
			
The focus therefore will be on showing that the school offer services for smaller group which aloud for 
more personalized tutoring depending on the need of the student at an affordable price or competing 
prices and for all ages.
			
Upon looking at various website over the internet I found that most use a clear layout to showcase 
theirs services with some using the colors their logos as base to convey their information, 
some others use a mixture. 
        
The plan is to use a 3 color palette that is inline with the brand and at the same time with a layout that 
looks professional, clean and not cluster.


## Design
		
### Logo
---
I will not be creating a logo since the school have one already. I will be working on the bases of 
the logo provided.
		
The logo has the school name (Hope Music Academy) with the "Hope" as the center stage and the treble 
clef replacing the "o" for Hope. It uses a green and black colours with some white lines. The background 
of the logo can be transparent but it seems to show better against a white back ground.
		
Since is a music school the logo seems appropriate for the intention and I will not suggest any changes, 
but will recommend to show the logo with a white back ground as much as possible.

### Colour Palette
---
From the small marketing research I did, I realized that there isn't a specific color associated with 
music teaching, therefore I will use color inline with the logo (green and black specifically) for 
continuity and consistency. 

I will be using a total of four colors palette on the website:

- #232323 (dark - Black/Dark brown)
- #399E5A (Green - ligther shade)
- #073B3A (Green - darker shade)
- #F0FFFF (azure - white)
		
### Typography / Fonts
---    
Fonts will be imported from the Google Font repository. The main text for all round is 
Raleway with Sand Serif as fall back font. With a default color of #073B3A (Green - darker shade)
againt white background. This color will be overwriten depanding on the background color need, i.e
for buttons font color will be #F0FFFF (azure - white) for example.

### Images
---
All the images used were photographs under the Creative Commons licenses taken form websites 
like Flickr, FreeImages.com, Pixabay and some images and video link from the actual 
Hope Music Academy - UK website with the agreement and knoledge of the owner.

### Skeleton
---
A .PDF file can be found [HERE](https://nickyfrs.github.io/hma-bds/Wireframes/HMA-BDS-Wireframe.pdf) with a wireframe meda with Figma shoing the mobile navigation 
idea for desktop and Mobile, as well as the footer wireframe for moile and the entire idea for 
the Homepage layout for the website

### Scope
---
I wanted visitors to the site to know straight away what it was about and what informtion they could 
find there. And I also wanted the structure to be very simple to enable users to make the minimum number 
of clicks to access the desired infomation. 

### User journey
---
To build a quick sense of familiarity, the navbar will be on the top right side of the screen 
moving to the middle of the screen on the mobile view. The navigation structure, content and 
location of the navbar will be the same for each webpage.

The navbar has 3 pages listed: Home , About and Contact. With Home page being the with most information 
about the services provided. The footer features all the ways the school can be contacted and a small 
quick contact form.

On the About page (link thru the navigation menu), the user sees a list of 4 sections which are the 
company's value. By degfaul each value/section is collapse, but expanding on mouse click to show its 
description. I further differentiate eac section with color that can be seeing on mouse hover for 
each section.  

Finally on the contact page the user will find a contact forma as a body of the page and underneath a google 
map shown the location of the address where lessons are held. In this page I employ the help of Bootstrap 
for the collapsible option and for the progress bars shown in the Core Value section where I use 
them for the company's 5 core values. 

90% for the website use custom code to produce a dynamic responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop 
use of this site. This included the repositioning of text over images to ensure legibility.


## Features

### Current Features
---
This site currently contains the following features:
- Home page - Two call to action sections, a small intro to the company, a section of the lessons provided, a Home Tuition video promo and a quick booking trial form.

## Testing
---
 A numbe r of testing was carried out once the website was completed. An Spreadsheet and PDFs files where created for all 
 the tests and can be found in the folder Test-Validation [https://github.com/NickyFrs/hma-bds/Test-Validation](https://github.com/NickyFrs/hma-bds/hma-bds/Test-Validation).
 
**Validations**

- The css stylesheet was inputted directly into the W3C CSS validator and approved for all 3 pages. 
- All pages - index.html, about.html and contact.html - were inputted directly into the W3C Markup validator. Errors and warnings for each page were addressed and then the page was rechecked through the validator. The process was repeated until no warning remained.
- A css stylesheet was created for each .html page.
- Color Contrast Validation carried out.
- Lighthouse Extended Report for performance produced.
- Request mas created.
- [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/)
- [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

**Manual testing**

- Manual testing was carried out on all the links and buttons on every page - all links in the footers and the navbars.
- The read more and submit buttons were all checked as well. 
- The collapse feature on About page works fine.
- The website was inspected using Google Chrome Dev Tools to view it on mobile and tablet versions. Each page was viewed and tested in these views.
- A small and quick peer review was carried out for look and responsiveness which came up with possitive feedback.

**Site Responsiveness**

To ensure compatibility and responsiveness I tested the site on multiple browsers and devices: 

- **Browsers:** Chrome, Opera, FireFox, Edge

- **Devices:** In addition to testing responsivness with chrome, Firefox, Edge inspector emulator tool I also asked four people to test on their mobile devicesand computers.

**Contact Form**

There are two conact forms on the site. 
 
If a site visitor is interested in contacting the school or booking a trialthe form will: 

1. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields(name and email) appears
2. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
3. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.


## Deployment of Website
---
This webiste was developed and hosted using **GitPod and GitHub pages** and stored in repositories on Github. 

Gitpod was installed as an extension
tool on google Chrome, which was accessed then via the project's repository page on Github. This allowed for 
regular version control updates:
0. git status was enterd to check for any changes on flie that needed commit.
1. git add . was entered into the command line interface to add files to the staging area.
2. git commit -m "" committed the files to the repository.
3. git push -u origin master pushed the master branch.
 
The website was deployed using Github Pages. To do this, while in the github webpages of the project repository: 
1. on the menu that apears on the right hand side of the page under 'Environments' you can find a link to `github-pages` with anc Active batch on the side.
2. Click on either, github-pages or Environments, it will take you to the `Deployment history` page.
3. Once on the Deployment history page on the right had side you will se a `View Deployment` button. 
4. Click on `View Deployment` and this will open the home page of the websit in a new window.
