## Project Description

	A part from putting to use the skills and techniques learned with Code Institute in HTML and CSS this project is also a prototype of a static website for an already established music school in Barbados. 
	
	The project idea is to showcase a  better build website than the one that they already have to show a more clean, attractive and organized front-end structure as well as a better back-end structure (a more clean and readable code). The focus of the website is the same as initially intended, Information about services provided and the school.  
	
	Since the school already has a website, it will be a good challenge to come up with a new way to present its content as well as incorporating new features in a way that is appealing and useful for both the users and the owners.


## 	Demo / Sample

    - Before
    - After

## 	User Experience (UX)

    ### External userâ€™s goal

        People like options, since up to date there is only one other school offering music classes in the country's market, I like the user to know that there are other music services out there that can be accessible to them with more user center focus when the visit the website.

        - User stories

            	* First Time Visitor Goals
					I want the visitor to see a clear layout of the information the owner wants to convey.
					That the visitor can clearly see and identify how to move around the website.
					I want visitors to have a way to contact the school easy.
					That they can find information about the teachers and services easy.
					
				* Returning Visitor Goals
					That information they might need later (like prices or exams details) would easily accessible at all time and easy to find.
					That they can see and read about the tutors working for the school at any given time.
					 
				* Frequent User Goals
					That users can see general information on different topics not only music (blog).
					See if there is any new member of staff and their information.
					See if there a new offers or news about the school or services provided.

    ### Site Owner's goals

		- As there is only one other music school in the area the owner wants to compete in the market.
		- Increase awareness of the school within the country.
		- To have a internet presence.
		- Promote subscriptions.
		- Promote accessible music teaching services.

    ### Market Research

		Looking at the scope of the island's music teaching opportunities, apart from individual personalized classes from independent tutors, there is only one music school. This present a competition opportunity and challenges. the classes offered are in group which make it difficult to target specific needs for the student. There's also competition in price as the group classes make it cheaper. 
			
		The focus therefore will be on showing that the owner offer services on a smaller group which aloud for more personalized tutoring depending on the need of the student at an affordable price or competing prices and for all ages.
			
		Upon looking at various website over the internet I found that most use a clear layout to showcase theirs services with some using the colors their logos as base to convey their information, some others use a mixture. 
        
        The plan is to use a color palette that is inline with the brand and at the same time color that have emotional meanings  with a layout that looks professional, clean and not cluster.

    
## Design
		
	### Logo

        I will not be creating a logo since the school have one already. I will be working on the  bases of the logo provided.
		
	    The logo has the school name (Hope Music Academy) with the "Hope" as the center stage and the treble clef replacing the "o" for Hope. It uses a green and black colours with some white lines.  The background of the logo can be transparent but it seems to show better against a white back ground.
		
	    Since is a music school the logo seems appropriate for the intention and I will not suggest any changes, but will recommend to show the logo with a white back ground as much as possible.
		
	### Colour Scheme

		From the small marketing research I did, I realized that there isn't a specific color associated with music teaching, therefore I will use the some of the color from the logo (green specifically) for continuity and consistency. 
		
		However on trying to be inclusive, I have researched the green color for colorblind people since 1 in 20 people are affected in some way. It seems to be a difficult color to work with for colorblind since the majority of them cannot see red nor green and the green is seen as a type of brownish color. So in order to try and  keep the green color, although maybe not de same shade of green as the logo, the focus would be on using a different shade of green, a darker one, as this will help with contrast when a color blind person see the color. According to Coloring for Colorblindness by by David Nichols, #1B5F34 dark green against a #FFF back ground it is safe to use for contrasting colors which maintain their contrast for people who are colorblind.
		
		Checking the two colors with a Contrast Checker from WebAIM.org I found the following:

			- #1B5F34 (Green - darker shade) -
				* none colorblind people can see,
				* Normal text and large text test (WCAG 2.0 level AA, WCAG Level AAA)   - Pass [^1],
				* Graphical Objects and User Interface Components (WCAG 2.0 level AA) - Pass [^1] 
				
			- #5C5433 (brownish color) 7.57:1 Contrast ratio
				* Colorblind people will see,
				* Normal text and large text test (WCAG 2.0 level AA, WCAG Level AAA)*   - Pass [^1],
				* Graphical Objects and User Interface Components (WCAG 2.0 level AA)* - Pass [^1] 
		
		[^1]: WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders). WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.
		
		[^1]: Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold or larger, or 18 point (typically 24px) or larger.
		
		I will use this color for the text against a white background as much as possible. Or Vise versa in the case of buttons, highlights, alerts, etc.
		
	### Typography / Fonts
    
		Fonts will be imported from the Google Font repository. The main text for all round is Roboto, it's a popular font familiar in a large number of websites and it is also clear and easy to read. 
		
		For the headings I'll use Montserrat Font and Sand Serif as fall back font.
